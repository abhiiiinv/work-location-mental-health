📊 Project Title: Analyzing the Impact of Mental Health Based on Work Location

📝 Description:

This project explores the relationship between work location (Remote, Hybrid, Onsite) and various aspects of employee mental health, stress levels, productivity, and work-life balance. Using data visualizations developed in both Power BI and Tableau, the dashboard presents clear and interactive insights to help organizations understand how work settings influence employee well-being.

🧠 Key Objectives:

* Understand the mental health conditions (burnout, anxiety, depression, none) across different work models.
* Analyze the average work-life balance ratings for remote, hybrid, and onsite employees.
* Visualize the impact of work location on stress levels and correlate it with age groups.
* Study employee productivity changes based on their working mode.
* Provide a gender breakdown and job role-wise distribution for additional demographic insights.

🔍 Key Visuals:

* Bar charts comparing work-life balance across work locations.
* Heat maps and stacked bars showing stress levels segmented by age group and work location.
* Donut chart for gender classification.
* Mental health condition comparison by work type.
* Job role distribution showing the diversity of the workforce.

📌 Tools Used:

* Power BI: For dynamic filtering, slicers, and KPI indicators.
* Tableau: For high-level interactivity, custom calculations, and intuitive storyboards.

💡 Insights Gained:

* Remote and hybrid employees tend to report slightly better work-life balance than onsite employees.
* The 36–50 age group faces the highest levels of stress, irrespective of work location.
* Mental health concerns like anxiety and burnout are relatively evenly distributed across work modes.
* Productivity changes do not vary drastically between work locations, but some shifts are notable in remote settings.
